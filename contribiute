#### FREE RANGE VHDL - how to contribute ####

FREE RANGE VHDL is written in Latex. source code is available from 
 https://github.com/fabriziotappero/Free-Range-VHDL-book

git (www.git-scm.com) is the version control system used to menage the 
content of this book. I personally use the Git Shell command line.
These instructions tell you how to contribute to the development
of the VHDL book "FREE RANGE VHDL".


1) Get the latest latex version of the book from github:
    git clone https://github.com/fabriziotappero/Free-Range-VHDL-book.git
    cd Free-Range-VHDL-book-master

2) you can see the history of the latest version of the book with:
    gitk

4) Modify and save any file you want.

5) use the command "compile" and the command "clean" to compile and 
   clean your final PDF. check the status of your work
   with the command:
    git status

5) create a patch with the command:
    git diff > my_patch.patch

6) copy and paste the content of the file "my_patch.patch" and an 
   explanation of what you have done to:

    http://freerangefactory.org/#contact
    
AN ALTERNATIVE AND MODERN WAY IS TO GENERATE A GITHUB PULL REQUEST.

I would love for you to do that.
